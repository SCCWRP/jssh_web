Materials for steelhead monitoring data, Santa Cruz region

## Misc

We are interested in including streamflow in a multivariate analysis.  DWA measured streamflows, but a few people donâ€™t have a lot of confidence in these measurements as just one spot measurements.   My supervisor, John Ricker, is very interested in this aspect of flow and hopefully, we could get you something before the analysis.   So, please make a note to follow up on that. 

For the other fish and wildlife, I am very interested in seeing which species occur at what sites.   We were thinking of trying to summarize these data by putting occurrence into categories such as (1) always present, (2) usually present (3) sometimes present (4) not present.   Austin Robey was thinking that you may be able to just look at # of occurrence over the data period and we could build categories from that.  

The data for the fish species will probably be better than for wildlife that would have a more patchy distribution.
