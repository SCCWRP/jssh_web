Data from the compiled geodatabase were extracted for exploratory analysis:

* `fishdat` spatial data of steelhead and coho salmon surveys, steelhead density is recorded for two size classes (shorter than 75mm, 75mm or longer)

* `habitat` data frame of habitat survey data

* `segment` spatial data for stream segments with fish data

* `stream` spatial data for complete hydrography for the four watersheds with fish and habitat data
